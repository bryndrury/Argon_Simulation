# Argon_Simulation

This is a personal project, use at your own risk.

The main computation for this project is done through c++ and the code should work standalone.
There is a python script called sim_.py that is meant to help automate running multiple simulations at once.
Just populate the lists N and L in the python file sim_.py with the number of particles and the size of the container repectivly and run.

**Warning** The program runs all the simulations and animations at once so limit the size of the N and L lists if your computer is but a mere mortal.
